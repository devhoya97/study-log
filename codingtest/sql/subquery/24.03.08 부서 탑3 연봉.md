| Column Name  | Type    |

| id           | int     |
| name         | varchar |
| salary       | int     |
| departmentId | int     |
+--------------+---------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
departmentId is a foreign key (reference column) of the ID from the Department table.
Each row of this table indicates the ID, name, and salary of an employee. It also contains the ID of their department.
 

Table: Department

id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the ID of a department and its name.
 

A company's executives are interested in seeing who earns the most money in each of the company's departments. A high earner in a department is an employee who has a salary in the top three unique salaries for that department.

Write a solution to find the employees who are high earners in each of the departments.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Employee table:
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| id | name  | salary | departmentId |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| 1  | Joe   | 85000  | 1            |
| 2  | Henry | 80000  | 2            |
| 3  | Sam   | 60000  | 2            |
| 4  | Max   | 90000  | 1            |
| 5  | Janet | 69000  | 1            |
| 6  | Randy | 85000  | 1            |
| 7  | Will  | 70000  | 1            |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
Department table:
+----+-------+
| id | name  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | IT    |
| 2  | Sales |
+----+-------+
Output: 
+------------+----------+--------+
| Department | Employee | Salary |
+------------+----------+--------+
| IT         | Max      | 90000  |
| IT         | Joe      | 85000  |
| IT         | Randy    | 85000  |
| IT         | Will     | 70000  |
| Sales      | Henry    | 80000  |
| Sales      | Sam      | 60000  |
+------------+----------+--------+
Explanation: 
In the IT department:
- Max earns the highest unique salary
- Both Randy and Joe earn the second-highest unique salary
- Will earns the third-highest unique salary

In the Sales department:
- Henry earns the highest salary
- Sam earns the second-highest salary
- There is no third-highest salary as there are only two employees

# 풀이
- departmentId 값을 먼저 추출하고, 이를 하나씩 순회하면서 distinct salary를 구하고, order by해서 limit 3까지만 해서....
- 위와 같은 흐름으로 풀려고 시도했는데, departmentId가 1,2,3으로 나왔을 때, 1,2,3 각각에 대해 iteration을 돌리는 방법을 찾지 못했다.
- 결국 못 풀고 다른 블로그 답안을 가져왔다.

```sql
SELECT D.NAME AS Department, E.NAME AS Employee, E.SALARY as Salary
FROM EMPLOYEE E
JOIN DEPARTMENT D ON E.DEPARTMENTID = D.ID
WHERE 3 > (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT E2.SALARY) 
	FROM EMPLOYEE E2
	WHERE E2.SALARY > E.SALARY and E2.departmentid = E.departmentid);
```

- 처음 생각한 풀이를 지피티가 어떻게 구현할 수 있는지 추천해줬는데, 결국 위 풀이랑 거의 비슷한 것 같다.
- 근데 이게 더 직관적이긴 한 듯?
- 근데 서브쿼리에서 limit이 불가능하다는데?
```sql
SELECT D.name AS Department, E.name AS Employee, E.salary AS Salary
FROM Employee E
JOIN Department D ON E.departmentId = D.id
WHERE E.salary IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT salary
    FROM Employee E2
    WHERE E2.departmentId = E.departmentId
    ORDER BY salary DESC
    LIMIT 3
);
```
